            <p>
                I have 3 cute male cats that I have been taking care of since they were 
                born. I named them Juma, Puma and Acil.
            </p>
            <p>
                Juma is the eldest son who has the full name "Jumanji" (because he is 
                an active child). Puma has the full name "Purnama" (because he was 
                born during the full moon phenomenon and has a black patch 
                over his right eye). Juma and Puma are 6 months apart. And the 
                youngest is Acil. Acil has the full name "Achilles" (at birth he has the 
                largest body compared to his siblings). Puma and Acil differ by 1 year.
            </p>
            <p>
                They have a different nature. Juma is the most aggressive. Little Juma 
                was very agile and he wasn't afraid to even scratch/attack me. Puma 
                has a very affectionate nature. Puma often licks his younger sibling and 
                accompanies him to sleep. Meanwhile, Acil is the most spoiled, 
                maybe because he's still a baby.
            </p>
            <P>
                How about you, do you have a cat? Can you share how your cat and its
                traits are with me??
